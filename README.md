# CredCheck
During pentesting, I realized I was spending too much time testing default credentials across different services and protocols. So I teamed up with a colleague who had a tool called [NmapAnalyzer](https://github.com/cvebezr/NmapAnalyzer).
The result was CredCheck — it analyzes output from NmapAnalyzer and attempts to try default credentials on every service it encounters.
